In the name of art, we are willing to do the craziest thing, and I think that's
the power of art. Lets use art as an excuse one more time and spread some love.

There is so much pain in this world, and the worst part is that we all seemed
to be too busy/distracted to care. When was the last time you really look into
someone's eyes with only a positive mindset? You will be surprise how a little
love a day, can go a long way. Is it possible to like strangers? Well, we seem
to have no problem hating strangers, so how much harder would loving them be? 

Now go partner up and look into that person's eyes for three whole minutes
while going through a list of things you like about him/her. At the end, don't
forget to whisper three things you like the most from that list to your partner
and ask him/her to do the same. #stopthehate #spreadthelove
